      <p class="bio-description">Caitlyn Campbell is originally from Kentucky, but better opportunities in the art world led her to Tennessee. Fine art was the main focus for her first 3 years in Nashville, but slowly transitioned to tattooing. Surrealism encompasses the themes in her personal work, but also loves the challenge of any subject/theme that is asked of her. Although she is early in her tattooing career, she is constantly growing and learning from the best daily.<br/></br/>Favorite things: puppies, dancing, horror films, spider-man, gym, surrealism, animals, chocolate, humbleness, dogs, zombies, trampolines, and drawing (obviously). </p>
