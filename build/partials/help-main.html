    <h3 class="help-sub-head">The longevity and vibrancy of your tattoo is directly related to how well you follow aftercare instructions:</h3>
    <ul class="help-list">
      <li>Leave bandage on overnight.</li>
      <li>In the morning, carefully remove the bandage and gently wash with Tea Tree bar soap.</li>
      <li>Tea Tree bar soap can be found at Whole Foods or in the Natureâ€™s Market section of Kroger.</li>
      <li>PAT dry with a clean paper towel, do not wipe.</li>
      <li>Apply a very thin layer of Aquaphor ointment and rub in until fully absorbed. Do this 2-3 times a day for 3-4 days.</li>
      <li>After 3-4 days stop using Aquaphor and switch to a fragrance-free and aloe-free lotion.</li>
      <li>We suggest Curel or Lubriderm. Use lotion 2-3 times per day for several weeks or until tattoo is fully healed.</li>
      <li>Once fully healed, apply sunscreen to your tattoo if you are outside for an extended period of time to avoid fading.</li>
      <li><span class="bold-text">DO NOT</span> pick at scabs, soak your tattoo or swim</li>
      <li><span class="bold-text">DO NOT</span> expose to direct sunlight/tanning</li>
      <li>Keep pets and children away from tattoos to avoid infection</li>
      <li>Touchups are for tattoo imperfections, not for poor aftercare</li>
    </ul>
